-Budget Allocation Problem can be reduced to Integer Linear Programming, a NP hard problem. Converted it to a SAT problem and then solve the problem using State of Art SAT solver.

-Cleaning Appratment Problem can be reduced to Hamiltonian path problem, a NP hard problem. Converted it to a SAT problem and then solve the problem using State of Art SAT solver.

-Implemented Edmonds-Karp, a maxflow algorithms after reducing Airlines Crews problem to maximum matching in Bipartite graph problem.
